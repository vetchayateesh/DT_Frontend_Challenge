# Deep Thought - Technical Project Management

Hey there! Welcome to my little web project called Deep Thought. It's all about making learning Technical Project Management fun and interactive through a simple web interface. Think of it as a digital classroom where you can dive into course materials without any fuss.

## What's This All About?

Imagine you're taking a course on Technical Project Management, and instead of boring textbooks or clunky platforms, you have this sleek web app that presents everything in a clean, engaging way. This project is my take on showcasing course content from the Deep Thought learning platform. It focuses on making complex management concepts feel approachable.

The app comes with a handy toolbar, sidebars that you can tuck away when you don't need them, and content cards that pop up with videos, articles, and interactive bits. It's like having a personal guide through project management topics like the 4SA Method, Threadbuild, and how to structure your thoughts effectively.

## What Can You Do With It?

- **Easy Navigation**: There's a toolbar at the top with a logo, home button, tools menu, notifications, and your profile pic – all responsive and works great on any screen.
- **Flexible Sidebar**: On the left, you'll find the Journey Board with course sections. Click the arrow to expand or collapse it, keeping things tidy.
- **Content Cards Galore**: The main area fills up with cards for different course assets. You'll see embedded YouTube videos, links to articles, and even interactive thread builders to play around with.
- **Quick Access Icons**: Floating icons on the right give you fast access to help, chat, and settings – always there when you need them.
- **Stay Informed**: The right sidebar acts as a notice board with updates and announcements.

## How I Built This

I kept things simple and modern:
- HTML5 for the solid foundation
- CSS3 with Flexbox and Grid for that polished look
- JavaScript (the latest stuff) to make everything dynamic and interactive
- Font Awesome icons to add that extra visual flair

No heavy frameworks or complicated setups – just good old web standards.

## Getting Started

Ready to check it out? Here's how:

1. Grab the project files by cloning or downloading them.
2. Make sure all the assets are tucked away in the `Asset/` folder just like they should be.
3. Open up `index.html` in your favorite web browser – that's it!

No need to install anything extra or run build scripts. It's ready to go right out of the box.

## How to Use It

Once you've got it open:

1. Start by exploring the toolbar icons to get a feel for the navigation.
2. Hit that arrow button to open or close the left sidebar – perfect for focusing on the content.
3. Scroll through the main area to discover all the course materials.
4. Play with the floating icons on the right for extra features like help or settings.

It's designed to be intuitive, so you should feel right at home.
